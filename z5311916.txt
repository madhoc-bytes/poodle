You should also include in this diary the following information (if applicable) about the
project progress:
- what was planned for the period since the last work diary entry.
- what was finished.
- what were the main technical and non-technical obstacles and how they were
overcome (or what was tried and did not work).
- what was not finished, why this happened, how this affects the overall project
progress and what adjustments (if any) are needed so the success of the project is not
endangered.
- what is planned for the next period (e.g., next week).
